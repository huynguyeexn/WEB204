Decoupling HTML From CSS
For years, the Web standards community has talked about the separation of concerns. Separate your CSS from your JavaScript from your HTML. We all do that, right? CSS goes into its own file; JavaScript goes in another; HTML is left by itself, nice and clean.

CSS Zen Garden proved that we can alter a design into a myriad of permutations simply by changing the CSS. However, we’ve rarely seen the flip side of this — the side that is more likely to occur in a project: the HTML changes. We modify the HTML and then have to go back and revise any CSS that goes with it.

In this way, we haven’t really separated the two, have we? We have to make our changes in two places.

Exploring Approaches

Over the course of my career, I’ve had the pleasure and privilege to work on hundreds of different websites and Web applications. For the vast majority of these projects, I was the sole developer building out the HTML and CSS. I developed a way of coding websites that worked well for me.

Most recently, I spent two years at Yahoo working on Mail, Messenger, Calendar and other projects. Working on a much larger project with a much larger team was a great experience. A small team of prototypers worked with a larger team of designers to build out all of the HTML and CSS for multiple teams of engineers.
